# Minecraft Recipe API

MC Recipe API. This comes with en_us language API thingy

Here's how you get the crafting recipe for an **Oak Door**.
https://mcrecapi.onrender.com/recipe/oak_door

That should return ```{"group":"wooden_door","key":{"#":{"item":"minecraft:oak_planks"}},"pattern":["##","##","##"],"result":{"count":3,"item":"minecraft:oak_door"},"type":"minecraft:crafting_shaped"}```

And now you want to get the en_us name of oak_planks:
mcrecapi.onrender.com/lang/oak_planks

*(Theres also a splash screen generator mcrecapi.onrender.com/splash )*
